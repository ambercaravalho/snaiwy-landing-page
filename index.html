        <section id="problem">
            <h2>⚠️ The Problem</h2>
            <p>Organizations frequently generate vast volumes of log data from security tools like Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel, but transforming this raw data into meaningful, interactive, and offline-friendly visual reports remains a time-consuming and technically demanding task.</p>
            <p>Security analysts, auditors, and IT leaders often struggle to quickly extract actionable insights, identify anomalies, and communicate findings in a visually compelling, self-contained format suitable for both technical and executive stakeholders. Existing solutions often rely on cloud services, lack customization, or fail to present data in a user-friendly, explorable way.</p>
